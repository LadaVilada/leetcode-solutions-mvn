# Java Algorithms & System Design | LeetCode Solutions


Welcome to my **Java Algorithms & System Design** repository!  
This project is a **collection of algorithm implementations** and **system design concepts** to prepare for **FAANG coding interviews** and **high-performance backend development**.

## Key Features
✅ **Algorithms**: Sorting, Searching, Graphs, Dynamic Programming  
✅ **Data Structures**: Linked Lists, Trees, HashMaps  
✅ **System Design**: Caching, Load Balancing, Microservices, Databases  
✅ **Concurrency**: Thread pools, Synchronization, Producer-Consumer  
✅ **Optimized Implementations**: `O(1)` Caching Strategies (LRU, LFU) 

## Technologies Used
- **Java 17+**
- **JUnit** (for testing)
- **Maven/Gradle** (for dependency management)
- **IntelliJ IDEA** (IDE)
- **Git** (Version Control)

## 🎯 System Design Topics
✅ **Scalable Caching Strategies** (LRU, LFU)  
✅ **Microservices Architecture** (API Gateway, Load Balancing)  
✅ **High-Performance Databases** (SQL Indexing, NoSQL Sharding)  
✅ **Concurrency & Multi-Threading** (Thread Pools, Locks)  
✅ **Rate Limiting & API Throttling** (Leaky Bucket, Token Bucket)  

## 📚 Algorithms Implemented
| Algorithm | Complexity | Description |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **Binary Search** | `O(log n)` | Fast searching in sorted arrays |
| **Merge Sort** | `O(n log n)` | Efficient divide & conquer sorting |
| **LRU Cache** | `O(1)` | Least Recently Used cache implementation |
| **LFU Cache** | `O(1)` | Least Frequently Used cache implementation |
